# 🛸 3D UFO Flight Simulation

A real-time 3D flight simulation project featuring a controllable UFO with dynamic animations, flying over procedurally generated terrain. Developed using modern OpenGL, this project showcases advanced rendering techniques and efficient GPU resource management.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic UFO Control:** Command a customizable UFO with realistic movement and unique swirling animations.
* **Advanced GLSL Shaders:** Custom-built shaders implementing:
    * Per-pixel Phong lighting for realistic illumination.
    * Sophisticated multi-pass transparency with blending and backface culling for complex visual effects.
    * Detailed texture mapping for all scene elements.
* **Procedural Terrain Generation:** Utilizes Perlin noise to generate expansive, dynamic landscapes on-the-fly, complete with calculated normals and UV coordinates for realistic shading and texturing.
* **Optimized GPU Rendering:** Efficient management of graphics data using Vertex Array Objects (VAOs), Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs), and Element Buffer Objects (EBOs) for optimized draw calls and memory usage.
* **Responsive Camera System:** A custom third-person camera class engineered to dynamically follow the UFO's position and orientation, enhanced by linear algebra and GLM for precise 3D transformations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Graphics API:** OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile
* **Shader Language:** GLSL
* **Windowing & Input:** GLFW
* **Mathematics:** GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **C++ Compiler:** A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC from Visual Studio).
* **OpenGL Drivers:** Ensure your graphics card drivers are up to date.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Visual Studio (Recommended for Windows):** The project is configured as a Visual Studio solution.
* **GLFW:** You will need to obtain GLFW binaries or compile it yourself.
    * **Recommended:** Download pre-compiled binaries for your Visual Studio version (e.g., `glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64.zip` from [GLFW's website](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)).

### Installation & Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lehshak/OpenGL_UFO_FlightSim.git](https://github.com/Lehshak/OpenGL_UFO_FlightSim.git)
    cd OpenGL_UFO_FlightSim
    ```

2.  **Set up GLFW:**
    * Unzip your downloaded GLFW binaries.
    * **Copy `glfw3.lib`** (from `lib-vcXXXX` folder, matching your Visual Studio version and `x64`) into a convenient location, e.g., a `Libs/glfw/lib/` folder in your project root, or directly configure your Visual Studio project to find it.
    * **Copy `glfw3.dll`** (from the `bin` folder) into the directory where your final executable will be generated (e.g., `OpenGLTUT/x64/Release/`).
    * **Ensure GLFW headers are accessible:** Add the path to GLFW's `include` directory (e.g., `path/to/glfw-3.3.8/include`) to your project's "Additional Include Directories" in Visual Studio.

3.  **Configure Visual Studio Project:**
    * Open `FlightSim.sln` in Visual Studio.
    * In the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project (`UFOFlightSim` or `OpenGLTUT` if not renamed) and select `Properties`.
    * At the top of the Properties window, set **`Configuration` to `Release`** and **`Platform` to `x64`**.
    * Navigate to `C/C++` -> `General` -> `Additional Include Directories` and add the paths for `glm` (e.g., `path/to/glm/`) and `glfw/include`.
    * Navigate to `Linker` -> `General` -> `Additional Library Directories` and add the path to your `glfw3.lib` (e.g., `path/to/glfw-3.3.8/lib-vcXXXX`).
    * Navigate to `Linker` -> `Input` -> `Additional Dependencies` and ensure `glfw3.lib` and `opengl32.lib` are listed.
    * Apply changes and close properties.

4.  **Build the project:**
    * In Visual Studio, go to `Build` -> `Rebuild Solution`.
    * The executable (`.exe`) will be generated in `OpenGLTUT/x64/Release/` (or similar, depending on your project name).

### Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the directory containing your compiled executable (e.g., `OpenGLTUT/x64/Release/`).
2.  Ensure `glfw3.dll` is present in this same directory.
3.  Double-click `UFOFlightSim.exe` (or your project's executable name) to run the simulation.

### Controls

* **W / S:** Move UFO Forward / Backward
* **A / D:** Strafe UFO Left / Right
* **Space:** Move UFO Up
* **Shift + Space:** Move UFO Down
* **Q / E:** Rotate UFO (Yaw) Left / Right
* **Mouse Scroll Wheel:** Adjust Camera Zoom (Field of View)

**Note:** The `OpenGLTUT` folder name in your `ls` output might indicate your main project folder. If you renamed the project within Visual Studio to `UFOFlightSim`, the `.vcxproj` file will also be named `UFOFlightSim.vcxproj`. Make sure the paths and names in the `README` match your actual project structure.
